1. Git clone this repo
2. cd into the directory, and [install Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/docs#how-to-install).
3. run `npm i` (this will take a minute or two the first time)
4. add a `.env` file with secret keys (ask the developer! this file should NEVER be committed)
5. run `gridsome develop` to run locally, or `gridsome build` to build a static version of the site. This will take about 10 seconds.
